# How to contribute to Light Engine

Thanks for putting in the time to contribute to this project <3

## Coding conventions

For the time being, don't worry too much about the conventions...

Try to read other parts of the code and you'll get the hang of it

I have to learn clang-format, then everyone contributing can use it to format their code


###### happy coding-
